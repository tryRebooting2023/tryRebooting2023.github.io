The goal of this project is improve the searching effectiveness of the University of Hawaiiâ€™s Ask Us search engine, which takes in user queries and attempts to return a list of IT-related articles that may help the users resolve their IT issues. We will be attempting to implement an AI search engine which will hopefully alleviate the need to contact the IT help desk.

We want this AI search engine to be able to to respond to queries as helpfully as possible. This means being able to ask follow-up questions to unclear queries and being conversational.

We plan on providing the interface for all users at the landing page, but also want to provide login capabilities in order for the AI to be able to store previous chat sessions.
