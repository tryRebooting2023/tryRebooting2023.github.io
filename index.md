### ITS Ask Us

The goal of this project is improve the searching effectiveness of the University of Hawaii's Ask Us search engine, which takes in user queries and attempts to return a list of IT-related articles that may help the users resolve their IT issues. We will be attempting to implement an AI search engine which will hopefully alleviate the need to contact the IT help desk.

We want this AI search engine to be able to to respond to queries as helpfully as possible. This means being able to ask follow-up questions to unclear queries and being conversational.

We plan on providing the interface for all users at the landing page, but also want to provide login capabilities in order for the AI to be able to store previous chat sessions.

## Installation

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to [https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react), and click the "Use this template" button. Complete the dialog box to create a new repository that you own that is initialized with this template's files.

Third, go to your newly created repository, and click the "Clone or download" button to download your new GitHub repo to your local file system.  Using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a great choice if you use MacOS or Windows.

Fourth, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/master/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:

```
 meteor npm run start 

> meteor-application-template-react@ start /Users/blues/Documents/GitHub/uh-askus-ai/app
> meteor --no-release-check --exclude-archs web.browser.legacy,web.cordova --settings ../config/settings.development.json

[[[[[ ~/Documents/GitHub/uh-askus-ai/app ]]]]]     

=> Started proxy.                             
=> Started HMR server.                        
=> Started MongoDB.                           
I20231104-20:34:33.148(-10)? Creating the default user(s)
I20231104-20:34:33.154(-10)?   Creating user admin@foo.com.
I20231104-20:34:33.805(-10)?   Creating user john@foo.com.

=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
```

Periodically, you might see `Error starting Mongo (2 tries left): Cannot run replSetReconfig because the node is currently updating its configuration` after the `=> Started HMR server.`. It doesn't seem to be a problem since the MongoDB does start.

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the imports/ directory with:

```
meteor npm run lint
```

## Walkthrough

#### Landing page

When you retrieve the app at http://localhost:3000, this is what should be displayed:

<img src="doc/landing-page-2.png">

In the inputfield to the left, you can type in your question, and click the search button to send it to the chat AI. After a couple of seconds it will generate a response for you based on a collection of ITS articles and their relevance to your query.

### CSS

The application uses the [React implementation of Bootstrap 5](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). You can adjust the theme by editing the `app/client/style.css` file. To change the theme override the Bootstrap 5 CSS variables.

```css
/* Change bootstrap variable values.
 See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/css-variables/
 */
body {
  --bs-light-rgb: 236, 236, 236;
}

/* Define custom styles */
.gray-background {
  background-color: var(--bs-gray-200);
  color: var(--bs-dark);
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```

### Routing

For display and navigation among its four pages, the application uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).

Routing is defined in [imports/ui/layouts/App.jsx](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/app/imports/ui/layouts/App.jsx).


### Authentication

For authentication, the application uses the Meteor accounts package.

When the application is run for the first time, a settings file (such as [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/config/settings.development.json)) should be passed to Meteor. That will lead to a default account being created through the code in [imports/startup/server/accounts.js](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/app/imports/startup/server/accounts.js).

The application allows users to register and create new accounts at any time.

### Authorization

Anyone accessing the page can use Ask Us. We will provide some additional features for logged in users in due time.

### Configuration

The [config](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/config) directory is intended to hold settings files.  The repository contains one file: [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/config/settings.development.json).

The [.gitignore](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/.gitignore) file prevents a file named settings.production.json from being committed to the repository. So, if you are deploying the application, you can put settings in a file named settings.production.json and it will not be committed.


### Quality Assurance

#### ESLint

The application includes a [.eslintrc](https://github.com/ics-software-engineering/meteor-application-template-react/blob/main/app/.eslintrc) file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```
[~/meteor-application-template-react/app]-> meteor npm run lint

> meteor-application-template-react@ lint /Users/philipjohnson/meteor-application-template-react/app
> eslint --quiet ./imports
```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It's significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as IntelliJ).
